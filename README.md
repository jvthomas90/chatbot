# chatbot

Just a bot. It says some stuff. Yep.

Topics of interest include, pearls_of_wisdom type quotes, musical reccomendations, advice on productivity topics, as well as a default list of random responses returned if none of the prior topics are chosen.

It essentially comes down to a While loop and an inordinate amount of nested if-elif-else statements. No actual senstience here, sorry human. Beep boop beep boop boop bop.
